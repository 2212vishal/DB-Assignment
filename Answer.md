Q 1} Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Solution: In the provided schemas, the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is established through a reference in the "Product" schema to the "productCategory" model.

Specifically, in the "Product" schema, the "category" field is defined as follows: category: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, required: true, ref: "productCategory", },

This field is of type mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, which means it stores the unique identifier (ObjectId) of a document in the "productCategory" collection. The ref: "productCategory" part specifies that the field references the "productCategory" model.

This setup allows each "Product" document to be associated with a specific "Product_Category" document. When you populate the "category" field in a "Product" document, you can retrieve the corresponding "Product_Category" document using Mongoose's populate method, which replaces the ObjectId in the "category" field with the actual "Product_Category" document.

Q2.} How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

solution: To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it using Mongoose in Node.js, you can modify the "Product" schema to include a custom validator for the "category" field. Here's an example syntax of how you can achieve this:

code: category: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, required: true, ref: "productCategory", validate: { validator: async function(value) { const category = await mongoose.model("productCategory").findById(value); return !!category; }, message: "Category does not exist", }, },

In this modified schema:-

1} The category field is defined with the type mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId to store the ObjectId of the category.

2} The ref option is set to "productCategory" to indicate that the category field references the "productCategory" model.

3} The validate property is added to the category field, which contains a custom validator function. This function uses findById to check if the referenced category exists in the "productCategory" collection. If the category exists, the validator returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

4} The message property specifies the error message to be displayed if the validation fails (i.e., if the category does not exist).

Mongoose will ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it based on the existence of the category in the "productCategory" collection.
